Welcome! 




I created this website at the start of my PhD (in May 2022) as a place for me to write freely about whatever aspect of my research I'd fancy writing about. I plan to share my experiences with the science, the fieldwork, and of course with whatever animals I happen to encounter along the way. Happy reading!

Cheers,

Yannick
