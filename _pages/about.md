Welcome! 




This website was created this website at the start of my PhD in May 2022 as a place for me to write freely about whatever aspect of my research I'd fancy writing about. Right now I am studying the effect of hunting pressure on tropical wildlife communities in French Guiana.

On this website I'll share my experiences with the science, the fieldwork, and of course with whatever animals I happen to encounter along the way. Happy reading!

Cheers,

Yannick
