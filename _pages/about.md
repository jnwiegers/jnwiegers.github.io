Welcome! 




This website was created in May 2022 as a place for me to write freely about whatever aspect of my research I'd fancy writing about. 

For my PhD, I am studying wildlife populations in the Guyana Shield in collaboration with the Office Français de la biodiversité and Parc amazonien de Guyane. Specifically, my aim is to test and develop new methods to estimate population densities of endangered Neotropical animals, such as tapirs, primates, and terrestrial birds. Depending on the target species, I make use of  trail cameras and acoustic recorders, and ideally combine the two methods.  

On this website I'll share my experiences with the science, the fieldwork, and of course with whatever animals I happen to encounter along the way. Happy reading!

Cheers,

Yannick
