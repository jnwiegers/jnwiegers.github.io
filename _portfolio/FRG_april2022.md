In May I went to French Guiana for the first time to set up my Phd research. Despite it being a work visit we saw a not so shabby number of animals during the weekend, all of which were new to me.

Highlights were our visit to the Marais the Caw (spectacled caimans & many wetland birds) a herpetological excursion with the Association Tr√©sor (fer-de-lances & many frogs), and as the cherry on top a nesting Leatherback sea turtle on the beach of Cayenne.
