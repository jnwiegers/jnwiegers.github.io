In May I had the opportunity to visit friends in Sainte-Thérence, Central France who where monitoring the local population of the Yellow-bellied toad (*Bombina variegata*).

We saw lots of wildlife, with as highlights Yellow-bellied & Midwife toads, Garden dormouse, European serin & bee-eater, Aesculapian snake, and Asp viper.
