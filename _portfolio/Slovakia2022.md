In July I made a road trip with friends and visited Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Czechia, and Belgium. While not a nature-oriented trip overall, we were nevertheless extremely fortunate to encounter a European Brown Bear during one of the days we actually went hiking, which was probably my coolest wildlife encounter in Europe ever! Other highlights were Golden Eagle (Slovakia) en European Badger (Belgium).
