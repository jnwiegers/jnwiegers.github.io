Today I gave a talk about the biology and identification of the seven terrestrial reptile species native to the Netherlands (technically we also have four vagrant sea turtle species). Unfortunately, I had COVID, so I gave the talk online instead of at the wonderfully decorated 'Natuurschuur'. For fun, here's a picture I took last week of my favourite snake species that can be found in the Netherlands.
